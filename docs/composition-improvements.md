3. **Security Layer**: Adds authentication, authorization, and policy enforcement
4. **Monitoring**: Provides telemetry and observability for wrapped servers
5. **Discovery**: Automatic discovery of MCP servers on the network
6. **Interception**: Pre/post execution hooks for tool calls

### FastMCP Composition Server Analysis

The FastMCP composition server offers workflow orchestration capabilities:

1. **Workflow Orchestration**: Combines multiple tools into complex workflows
2. **Sequential Execution**: Chains tools together with data flow between them
